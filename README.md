# INTRODUCTION
For my Algorithms Design course, I was tasked with creating an algorithm that met the following criteria:

- Generate array from input file
- Handle potential arrays
- Time Complexity should be O(n)

The algorithm should analyze an array of size n. For example [10,4,1,4,14,2]. Then, it should find the highest sum possible for numbers THAT ARE NOT NEIGHBORS.

For example, is it:

11 which is derived from [10,1]?
29 which is derived from [10,1,14]?
24 which is derived from [10,14]?
